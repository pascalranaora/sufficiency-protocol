# Finite Money for a Finite Planet  
**A Degrowth–Bitcoin Manifesto**

We reject the infinity lie.  
Earth is finite. Attention is finite. Joy is finite.  
**Bitcoin is the first money that admits it.**

---

**I. The 21 Million Ceiling**  
Degrowth demands we **cap extraction**. Bitcoin **already did**: 21 000 000 coins, never more.  
After ~2140, **zero new issuance**. Monetary production **degrows to zero** by design.

---

**II. Energy as Commons, Not Commodity**  
Mining is **not waste**—it is **co-generation**.  
- Stranded flare gas → BTC + zero methane.  
- Curtailed wind → BTC + district heat.  
- Solar spill → BTC + greenhouse mushrooms.  

**Rule**: Mine **only where energy would vanish**.  
Result: **Proof-of-Useful-Work**, not endless growth.

---

**III. Sufficiency, Not Speculation**  
HODL culture is **anti-consumption**.  
Long-term holders **lock capital in cold storage**, starving the growth machine.  
1 BTC in a seed-phrase vault = **1 less yacht, 1 more forest**.

**IV. Local Loops, Global Bridge**  
Communities issue **EcoSats**:  
`1 EcoSat = 1 sat + 1 kWh local solar / 1 hour repair / 1 kg compost`  
Spend locally. Exit to BTC **only when necessary**.  
**Inflation-proof bridge** between gift economies and planetary liquidity.

---

**V. The Last Gold Rush**  
Bitcoin is **humanity’s final extractive frontier**.  
After it, **no more monetary colonialism**.  
We mine math, not mountains.

---

**Call to Action**  
1. Run a **RaspiBolt node** on your rooftop solar.  
2. Start a **time-bank** pegged to sats.  
3. Lock **1 % of your treasury** in multisig for **perpetual land trusts**.  

**Degrowth + Bitcoin = Sufficiency, coded in scarcity.**  
The revolution will be **capped at 21 million**.
