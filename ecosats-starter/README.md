# EcoSats for Beginners — “Village Money That Makes Sense”

## The Idea
1 EcoSat = 1 tiny Bitcoin piece + 1 real helpful thing  
You earn by sharing. You spend locally. You swap to Bitcoin if needed.

## Example
- Ana has extra sun → earns ☀100  
- Luis fixes bike → earns ⚒50  
- Maria bakes → earns 🌱50  
→ Everyone eats, no euros needed!

## What You Need
- 10+ friends  
- 1 Raspberry Pi (€80)  
- €100 in Bitcoin  
- Phone with Minibits app

## 10-Week Plan
1. Meet → pick 5 leaders  
2. Buy Pi + SSD  
3. Make list: ☀⚒🌱  
4. Create group Bitcoin wallet  
5. Connect solar (optional)  
6. Install wallet app  
7. Print QR stickers  
8. First trade day!

## Rules
- Lose 2% per month if you hoard  
- Swap max 10% to Bitcoin  
- Everything public & fair
