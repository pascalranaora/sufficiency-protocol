# **Bitcoin Degrowth/PostGrowth Manifesto — For Degrowth/PostGrowth Economists**  
**“A Post-Growth Monetary System That Respects the Entropy Law”**  
*Finite Money for a Finite Planet — With Rigorous Equations*

---

> **To the post-growth research community:**  
> This is **not Bitcoin maximalism**.  
> This is **thermodynamically honest money** — a **post-growth monetary layer** that **caps throughput**, **internalizes entropy**, and **downscales by design**.

## 1. **Core Claim**  
> **“Degrowth is not austerity — it is selective downscaling of throughput while improving wellbeing.”**  
> — Parrique (2019)

**Our response**:  
> **EcoSats is selective downscaling of *monetary throughput* — money supply is capped by local low-entropy capacity, not GDP.**

---

## 2. **Georgescu-Roegen’s Entropy Law — Formalized**

$$\
\frac{dS}{dt} \geq 0 \quad \text{(Second Law)}
\$$
$$\
\frac{dS_{\text{economy}}}{dt} = \underbrace{\frac{dS_{\text{resource depletion}}}{dt}}_{\text{low-entropy fund}} + \underbrace{\frac{dS_{\text{pollution}}}{dt}}_{\text{high-entropy sink}}
\$$

**Fiat money** pretends $$\( \frac{dS}{dt} = 0 \)$$ → **infinite claims on finite stocks**.  
**EcoSats** enforces:

$$\
M_t \leq k \cdot (F_t - S_t)
\$$

where:  
- $$\( F_t \)$$ = **low-entropy fund** (renewable flows + non-renewable stocks)  
- $$\( S_t \)$$ = **high-entropy sink capacity** (pollution absorption)  
- $$\( k \)$$ = **sufficiency conversion factor** (e.g., 1 ES = 1 kWh or 1 hour)

---

## 3. **Monetary Throughput = Material Throughput**

| Indicator | Fiat | EcoSats |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Monetary throughput** $$(\( \Delta M / M \))$$ | $$\( r \)$$ (exogenous) | $$\( \leq \Delta L / L \)$$ (endogenous) |
| **Material throughput** $$(\( T \))$$ | $$\( T \propto M \)$$ (Kuznets) | $$\( T \propto L_t \)$$ (capped) |
| **Decoupling?** | Illusion | **Structural** |

> **EcoSats achieves *absolute decoupling* of money from throughput** — because $$\( M_t \)$$ is **bounded by $$\( L_t \)$$**.

---

## 4. **The Sufficiency Production Function**

Replace neoclassical $$\( Y = F(K, L) \)$$ with:

$$\
Y_t = f(L_t, \sigma_t)
\$$

- $$\( L_t \)$$ = **local low-entropy services** (kWh, hours, kg)  
- $$\( \sigma_t \)$$ = **social sufficiency threshold** (e.g., 2000 kWh/person/year)  
- $$\( f \)$$ = **non-substitutable** (no capital-energy substitution beyond $$\( \sigma_t \)$$)

$$\
\boxed{M_t = \min\left( M^{\text{BTC cap}}, \; \alpha \cdot (L_t - \sigma_t \cdot N) \right)}
\$$

> **No money issued for luxury throughput above sufficiency.**

---

## 5. **Demurrage as Negative Interest (Gesell + Keynes)**

$$\
i_{\text{demurrage}} = -2\% \text{ per month} \quad \text{for } B_t > 1000 \text{ ES}
\$$

- **Gesell (1916)**: “Money should rust like iron.”  
- **Keynes (1936)**: “Negative interest to stimulate circulation.”  
- **Parrique (2023)**: “We need *degrowth-compatible finance*.”

**EcoSats delivers**:  
- **Circulation velocity** $$\( v \uparrow \)$$  
- **Hoarding** $$\( H \downarrow \)$$  
- **Investment in care/repair** $$\( I_{\text{regenerative}} \uparrow \)$$

---

## 6. **Steady-State Money Supply (Daly’s Impossibility Triangle)**

Herman Daly (1977):  
> **“A growing economy cannot have (1) constant population, (2) constant stock of capital, and (3) constant throughput.”**

**EcoSats resolves**:

| Variable | EcoSats |
|--------|--------|
| Population | $$\( N_t \)$$ (exogenous) |
| Capital stock | $$\( K_t \)$$ (maintenance only) |
| **Throughput** | $$\( T_t \leq L_t \)$$ → **capped by design** |

$$\
\boxed{T_t = \min(T_{t-1}, L_t)}
\$$

→ **Monetary steady-state** without central planning.

---

## 7. **Empirical Testable Hypotheses**

| Hypothesis | Metric | Data Source |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **H1**: EcoSats reduces material footprint | $$\( T / M \)$$ | Local energy meters, time logs |
| **H2**: Demurrage increases local multiplier | $$\( v = M / T \)$$ | Transaction logs |
| **H3**: Sufficiency peg reduces inequality | Gini of $$\( B_t \)$$ | Wallet balances |
| **H4**: Exit cap prevents financialization | $$\( \text{BTC exit} / M_t \)$$ | Vault logs |

> **Ready for longitudinal study in 3 pilot villages (2026–2029)**.

---

## 8. **Policy Alignment with Degrowth Agenda**

| Degrowth Goal | EcoSats Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Cap resource use** | $$\( M_t \leq L_t \)$$ |
| **Reduce inequality** | Demurrage + HODL lock |
| **Localize economies** | Sufficiency units (☀⚒🌱) |
| **Decouple wellbeing from GDP** | Money issued for care, not growth |

---

## 9. **One-Page Executive Summary**

```latex
\begin{align*}
M_t^{\text{EcoSats}} &= \min\!\left( M^{\text{BTC}}, \; \alpha (L_t - \sigma N) \right) \\
L_t &= E_t + H_t + C_t \\
\frac{dM}{dt} &\leq \frac{dL}{dt} \\
i &= -0.02 \quad \text{(demurrage)} \\
T_t &\leq L_t \quad \text{(throughput cap)}
\end{align*}
```

## 10. **Call to Economists**

In this repository, we are attempting to extend Satoshi Nakamoto original ideas to make them Degrowth compatible. A global monetary system that could apply to local communities without the need on relying on trust of central authorities (a transparent and automated system) and without the need on inventing new local currencies but instead use global template that could be used Worldwide and adapted to the Digital Era.

According to Economists, Money is a technology to move Value across Space, Time, and Scale.

Value is the utility humans derive from Goods & Services.
Value is highly subjective, and it changes across Time and Space.
Unbeknownst to them, Economists have defined these functions as:

- Store of Value (Time)
- Medium of Exchange (Space)
- Unit of Account (Scale)

Throughout History, no monetary system has managed to satisfy all 3 functions of Money at once. This is where the idea of Backing Money and the necessity of separating Money and Currency come from.

This trade-off can be described as a Money Trilemma: you can optimize for 2, but not all 3.

- Gold is great at Time & Scale, but not Space.
- Fiat is great at Space & Scale, but not Time.
- Local currencies are not complete currencies. They optimize local space, but sacrifice scale and time.

Until the invention of Bitcoin.

**Bitcoin is the first form of Money that excels simultaneously in all three functions.**
With our research here we believe Bitcoin could be a pivotal technology that allows humanity to finally use/comply with thermodynamic laws (which are the same everywhere on Earth) locally, at scale and to peg it back to a global monetary system that would have other benefits for global coordination (a common unit of account to measure value the same way everywhere on Earth) solving for the (Space,Time,Scale) Trilemma. 


John Nash, in his original article "Ideal Money" published in the [Southern Economic Journal (Vol. 69, No. 1, July 2002, pp. 4-11](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2325-8012.2002.tb00474.x), discusses monetary stability as an ideal comparable to physical units of measurement.

Something he will also highlight in lectures such as the one given at Princeton University or at the European School of Economics in 1997, and extended versions in 2002-2008 (available online, for example, [here](https://web.math.princeton.edu/jfnj/texts_and_graphics/Main.Content/IDEAL_MONEY.../Older/PENN_STATE/babu.money.b.pdf)

He discusses an "ideal" currency that would be stable and free from "inflationary decadence" (intrinsically free of "inflationary decadence"), and which would asymptotically (that is, gradually, approaching a limit) a constant value, comparable to a unit of measurement such as the watt or the degree of temperature. He emphasizes zero inflation as an ideal objective, measured by domestic or international price indices, to facilitate utility transfers in game theory and promote long-term economic well-being. "The ideal concept would necessarily be that of a zero rate for what is called inflation."

“Money should have the function of a standard of measurement and thus that it should become comparable to the watt or the hour or a degree of temperature.” 


**We therefore invite Degrowth Economists and the Degrowth Journal to:**  
1. **Peer-review** the thermodynamic model
2. **Co-design** some pilot studies ?
3. **Publish** or consider Bitcoin in some original new work in *Ecological Economics* or *Degrowth Journal* and help complete John Nash vision with a neutral technology that we could make Degrowth compatible
