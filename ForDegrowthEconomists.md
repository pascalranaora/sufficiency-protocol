# **Bitcoin Degrowth Manifesto — For Degrowth Economists**  
**“A Post-Growth Monetary System That Respects the Entropy Law”**  
*Finite Money for a Finite Planet — With Rigorous Equations*

> **To the post-growth research community:**  
> This is **not Bitcoin maximalism**.  
> This is **thermodynamically honest money** — a **post-growth monetary layer** that **caps throughput**, **internalizes entropy**, and **downscales by design**.

## 1. **Core Claim**  
> **“Degrowth is not austerity — it is selective downscaling of throughput while improving wellbeing.”**  
> — Parrique (2019)

**Our response**:  
> **EcoSats is selective downscaling of *monetary throughput* — money supply is capped by local low-entropy capacity, not GDP.**

---

## 2. **Georgescu-Roegen’s Entropy Law — Formalized**

$$\
\frac{dS}{dt} \geq 0 \quad \text{(Second Law)}
\$$
$$\
\frac{dS_{\text{economy}}}{dt} = \underbrace{\frac{dS_{\text{resource depletion}}}{dt}}_{\text{low-entropy fund}} + \underbrace{\frac{dS_{\text{pollution}}}{dt}}_{\text{high-entropy sink}}
\$$

**Fiat money** pretends $$\( \frac{dS}{dt} = 0 \)$$ → **infinite claims on finite stocks**.  
**EcoSats** enforces:

$$\
M_t \leq k \cdot (F_t - S_t)
\$$

where:  
- $$\( F_t \)$$ = **low-entropy fund** (renewable flows + non-renewable stocks)  
- $$\( S_t \)$$ = **high-entropy sink capacity** (pollution absorption)  
- $$\( k \)$$ = **sufficiency conversion factor** (e.g., 1 ES = 1 kWh or 1 hour)

---

## 3. **Monetary Throughput = Material Throughput**

| Indicator | Fiat | EcoSats |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Monetary throughput** $$(\( \Delta M / M \))$$ | $$\( r \)$$ (exogenous) | $$\( \leq \Delta L / L \)$$ (endogenous) |
| **Material throughput** $$(\( T \))$$ | $$\( T \propto M \)$$ (Kuznets) | $$\( T \propto L_t \)$$ (capped) |
| **Decoupling?** | Illusion | **Structural** |

> **EcoSats achieves *absolute decoupling* of money from throughput** — because $$\( M_t \)$$ is **bounded by $$\( L_t \)$$**.

---

## 4. **The Sufficiency Production Function**

Replace neoclassical $$\( Y = F(K, L) \)$$ with:

$$\
Y_t = f(L_t, \sigma_t)
\$$

- $$\( L_t \)$$ = **local low-entropy services** (kWh, hours, kg)  
- $$\( \sigma_t \)$$ = **social sufficiency threshold** (e.g., 2000 kWh/person/year)  
- $$\( f \)$$ = **non-substitutable** (no capital-energy substitution beyond $$\( \sigma_t \)$$)

$$\
\boxed{M_t = \min\left( M^{\text{BTC cap}}, \; \alpha \cdot (L_t - \sigma_t \cdot N) \right)}
\$$

> **No money issued for luxury throughput above sufficiency.**

---

## 5. **Demurrage as Negative Interest (Gesell + Keynes)**

$$\
i_{\text{demurrage}} = -2\% \text{ per month} \quad \text{for } B_t > 1000 \text{ ES}
\$$

- **Gesell (1916)**: “Money should rust like iron.”  
- **Keynes (1936)**: “Negative interest to stimulate circulation.”  
- **Parrique (2023)**: “We need *degrowth-compatible finance*.”

**EcoSats delivers**:  
- **Circulation velocity** $$\( v \uparrow \)$$  
- **Hoarding** $$\( H \downarrow \)$$  
- **Investment in care/repair** $$\( I_{\text{regenerative}} \uparrow \)$$

---

## 6. **Steady-State Money Supply (Daly’s Impossibility Triangle)**

Herman Daly (1977):  
> **“A growing economy cannot have (1) constant population, (2) constant stock of capital, and (3) constant throughput.”**

**EcoSats resolves**:

| Variable | EcoSats |
|--------|--------|
| Population | $$\( N_t \)$$ (exogenous) |
| Capital stock | $$\( K_t \)$$ (maintenance only) |
| **Throughput** | $$\( T_t \leq L_t \)$$ → **capped by design** |

$$\
\boxed{T_t = \min(T_{t-1}, L_t)}
\$$

→ **Monetary steady-state** without central planning.

---

## 7. **Empirical Testable Hypotheses**

| Hypothesis | Metric | Data Source |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **H1**: EcoSats reduces material footprint | $$\( T / M \)$$ | Local energy meters, time logs |
| **H2**: Demurrage increases local multiplier | $$\( v = M / T \)$$ | Transaction logs |
| **H3**: Sufficiency peg reduces inequality | Gini of $$\( B_t \)$$ | Wallet balances |
| **H4**: Exit cap prevents financialization | $$\( \text{BTC exit} / M_t \)$$ | Vault logs |

> **Ready for longitudinal study in 3 pilot villages (2026–2029)**.

## 8. **Policy Alignment with Degrowth Agenda**

| Degrowth Goal | EcoSats Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Cap resource use** | $$\( M_t \leq L_t \)$$ |
| **Reduce inequality** | Demurrage + HODL lock |
| **Localize economies** | Sufficiency units (☀⚒🌱) |
| **Decouple wellbeing from GDP** | Money issued for care, not growth |

---

## 9. **One-Page Executive Summary (For Parrique’s Desk)**

```latex
\begin{align*}
M_t^{\text{EcoSats}} &= \min\!\left( M^{\text{BTC}}, \; \alpha (L_t - \sigma N) \right) \\
L_t &= E_t + H_t + C_t \\
\frac{dM}{dt} &\leq \frac{dL}{dt} \\
i &= -0.02 \quad \text{(demurrage)} \\
T_t &\leq L_t \quad \text{(throughput cap)}
\end{align*}
```

## 10. **Call to Economists**

In this repository, we are attempting to extend Satoshi Nakamoto original ideas to make them Degrowth compatible. A global monetary system that could apply to local communities without the need on relying on trust of central authorities (a transparent and automated system). 

According to economists, Money should be a technology that allows the transfer of value across space, time, and scale.
Value is the utility that humans ascribe to goods and services. It is highly subjective and varies across time and space.

Unwittingly, economists have defined the functions of money as follows:

- Store of value (Time)
- Medium of exchange (Space)
- Unit of account (Scale)

Throughout history, no monetary system has managed to simultaneously fulfill all three functions of money. This is the origin of the idea of ​​guaranteeing money and the need to distinguish between currency and foreign exchange.

This trade-off can be described as a monetary trilemma: two functions can be optimized, but not all three.

Gold excels in time and scale, but not in space. Fiat currency excels in space and scale, but not in time. Local currencies are not complete currencies.
They optimize local space, but sacrifice scale and time.

**Bitcoin is the first form of currency we have invented that excels simultaneously in all three functions.**
With the research here, we believe Bitcoin could be a pivotal technology that allows humanity to finally use/comply with thermodynamic laws (which are the same everywhere around Earth) at scale and to peg it back to a global monetary system that would have other benefits for global coordination (common unit of measure of value everywhere on Earth).



> **We therefore invite Degrowth Economists and the Degrowth Journal to:**  
> 1. **Peer-review** the thermodynamic model  
> 2. **Co-design** some pilot studies ?
> 3. **Publish** original new work in *Ecological Economics* or *Degrowth Journal*
