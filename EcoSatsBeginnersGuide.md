# **EcoSats for Beginners**  
**“Money that works like a village garden”**  
*November 2025 — Read this in 10 minutes, launch in 10 weeks*

---

## Imagine This…

You grow tomatoes 🍅.  
Your neighbor fixes bikes 🚲.  
Another friend has extra solar power ☀️ at noon.

**EcoSats** lets you **trade without euros or dollars** — using **Bitcoin + real things** you already do.

---

## The Big Idea in 3 Sentences

1. **EcoSats = 1 tiny piece of Bitcoin + 1 helpful thing** (like 1 hour help or 1 kWh sun power).  
2. You **earn** them by helping or sharing.  
3. You **spend** them locally — or **swap** for real Bitcoin if you need to buy something online.

---

## Real-Life Example (Super Simple)

| Person | Does | Gets | Spends |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| **Ana** | Has extra solar power (nobody uses it) | **100 EcoSats** (`☀️`) | Pays Luis |
| **Luis** | Fixes Ana’s bike (1 hour) | **50 EcoSats** (`⚒️`) | Buys bread |
| **Maria** | Bakes bread with compost | **50 EcoSats** (`🌱`) | Happy! |

→ No bank. No fees. No inflation.

---

## Your EcoSats “Bank” = A Phone + A Group

| What You Need | What It Does |
|---------------|--------------|
| **A phone** | Your wallet (free app) |
| **A village group** | Decides what counts as “helpful” |
| **A small computer** (Raspberry Pi) | Runs the “EcoSats printer” |
| **A little Bitcoin** | The “gold” that backs it |

---

## Step-by-Step: Start EcoSats in Your Town

### **Week 1: The Village Meeting**
1. **Gather 10 friends** at the café.  
2. **Pick 5 leaders** (they rotate every 6 months).  
3. **Make a list** of helpful things:  
   - ☀️ = 1 kWh extra solar/wind  
   - ⚒️ = 1 hour fixing, teaching, caring  
   - 🌱 = 1 kg compost or food grown  

Print it on **one A4 sheet** and stick it on the wall.

---

### **Week 2: The “Treasure Box”**
1. **Buy a cheap Raspberry Pi** (€80) + SSD (€60).  
2. **5 leaders create a shared Bitcoin wallet** (like a group safe).  
   - They need **3 out of 5** to open it.  
   - Put in **€100 of Bitcoin** to start.  

This is your **EcoSats vault**.

---

### **Week 3: Connect the Sun**
1. If you have **solar panels**, add a **smart meter** (€50–300).  
2. It tells the Pi: “Hey, 200 kWh went unused today!”  
3. The Pi **prints 200 EcoSats** (`☀200`) to the owner’s phone.

No solar? → Skip! Start with **hours** (`⚒`) only.

---

### **Week 4: Give Everyone a Wallet**
1. Download **Minibits** app (free, no ID needed).  
2. Print **QR code stickers** (like gift cards).  
3. Give one to every member with **10 EcoSats free** to try.

---

### **Week 5: First Trade Day!**
- Ana scans Luis’s QR → sends **50 EcoSats** for bike fix.  
- Luis sends **30 EcoSats** to Maria for bread.  
- Maria keeps **20 EcoSats** in her phone.

**It just works.**

## What Happens to Old EcoSats?

| Rule | Why? |
|------|------|
| **Use it or lose 2 % per month** | Stops rich people hoarding |
| **Can’t have >5 000 without locking 1 year** | Keeps money moving |
| **Want real Bitcoin?** → Trade EcoSats back to the vault | Only 10 % per month allowed |

## FAQ for Grandma

**Q: Is this real money?**  
A: Yes! Backed by Bitcoin + real work. Safer than cash under the mattress.

**Q: What if someone cheats?**  
A: The 5 leaders check. Everything is written on Bitcoin (can’t fake).

**Q: Can I lose my EcoSats?**  
A: Only if you lose your phone **and** your backup paper. Write 12 words on paper!

**Q: Why not just use euros?**  
A: Euros lose value. EcoSats **stay fair** and reward local help.

# **BONUS: Why a Pleb Uses EcoSats Instead of Raw Sats**  
**“Sats are global. EcoSats are *yours*.”**

| Pleb’s Daily Life | Raw Sats | **EcoSats** |
|-------------------|--------|-------------|
| **You fix your neighbor’s bike** | No one pays you in sats | **Earn 50 ES** (`⚒50`) → spend at bakery |
| **You have extra solar at noon** | Sats don’t care | **Earn 100 ES** (`☀100`) → pay rent |
| **You grow tomatoes** | No sat reward | **Earn 30 ES** (`🌱30`) → buy tools |
| **You want bread from Maria** | She wants **local** | **Pay 40 ES** → she accepts instantly |
| **You need to buy online** | Use raw sats | **Swap 100 ES → 100 sats** (10 % cap) |

## **10 Pleb Reasons (No Jargon)**

| # | Reason | Raw Sats | **EcoSats** |
|---|--------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Earn for real work** | Only mining or trading | **Fixing, growing, sharing = ES** |
| 2 | **Spend where you live** | Merchants want fiat | **Co-op, café, neighbor accept ES** |
| 3 | **No volatility stress** | 1 sat = $0.0006 → panic | **1 ES = 1 hour help** (stable value) |
| 4 | **Money that *helps* you** | HODL or lose | **Demurrage pushes you to spend local** |
| 5 | **Exit when *you* need** | Always on-chain fees | **Swap ES → sats** (smooth, capped) |
| 6 | **No KYC** | Some on-ramps ask ID | **Minibits wallet = phone + QR** |
| 7 | **Backed by Bitcoin** | Yes | **Yes + your village** |
| 8 | **No inflation** | 21 M cap | **Capped + local cap** |
| 9 | **You control the rules** | Bitcoin rules | **Your council votes on ☀⚒🌱** |
| 10 | **Feels like community** | Cold ledger | **Warm bread, fixed bike, shared sun** |

## **Pleb’s Weekly Flow (EcoSats)**

```text
Monday: 2 kWh solar spill → +200 ES (☀)
Tuesday: Fix bike (1 hr) → +100 ES (⚒)
Wednesday: Buy bread → –80 ES
Thursday: Sell tomatoes → +60 ES (🌱)
Friday: Swap 50 ES → 50 sats (online order)
Saturday: Balance = 280 ES → spend or demurrage eats 2%
```

**Raw Sats?** → You’d need to **sell labor for fiat → buy BTC** → **pay fees**.  
**EcoSats?** → **Direct, local, instant.**

## **Metaphor: Sats vs EcoSats**

| | **Sats** | **EcoSats** |
|--|--------|------------|
| Like | **Gold bar in a vault** | **Gift card at your co-op** |
| Use | Save or trade globally | **Spend daily, earn daily** |
| Value | Market price | **Your time + sun + soil** |

## **Pleb’s One-Liner**

## **Try It in 5 Minutes**

1. **Download Minibits** (App Store / Play)  
2. **Scan village QR** → get 10 ES free
